# LearningGo

Hello, this is my documentation to when I'm learning Go. I copied this style of learning to the tiktoker "thoughtsontect" or Albert Diones, he spent 10 mins everyday learning to code so I was interested because I have so much free time. But I am not doing 10 mins a day, I will try to complete 3 tasks each day and review/study it so I dont forget about it.

**Task 1**
  The task is easy just download the IDE and run Hello World.

**Task 2**
  declare 2 string variables, 1 is hello, 1 is world, concatenate to say hello world
  It is easy I just declare a 2 variable tas contains hello and world then print it

**Task 3**
  Trim whitespace from strings using built in function
  You need to use "strings.TrimSpace"

**Task 4**
  uppercase-all and lowercase-all strings using built in function
  Use strings.ToUpper to capitalize all the strings
  Use strings.ToLower to lower case all the strings

**Task 5**
  capitalize(uppercase first letter of each word) strings using built in function
  You cant use strings.Title because it was deprecated now, Use cases.Title(langauge.English), you also need to import "golang.org/x/text/cases" and "golang.org/x/text/language" to use the function

**Task 6**
  concatenate integer and string without getting an error
  to concatenate or link interger and string you need to use fmt.Sprint(word, num)
